# Taurus SDK

This is my fork of [CDAC Aries](https://vegaprocessors.in/devboards) SDK with additional changes. It is an experiment and mostly for learning how such systems work, for now.

## Comparison with official SDK
- Examples moved to seperate [repository](https://github.com/rnayabed/taurus-examples).
- Cleaner code
    - UART
